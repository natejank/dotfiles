#!/bin/bash
# thin wrapper to use imagemagick to convert images to pdf
# - reads EXIF data to rewrite images to be correctly oriented
# - resizes them to <= 1080p (vertical) to save space, while still being
# legible so long as your homework isn't across the room from you
# - outputs as a pdf
#
# note: on some distributions of Linux, you may have to change your security
# policy to allow ImageMagick/GhostScript to read and write PDFs.  This is
# disabled by default to protect servers processing untrusted inputs,
# but is likely fine for you.
# see: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1181762/imagemagickconvert-im6-q16-no-images-defined

# usage: converttopdf image1 image2 image3 ... imageN
